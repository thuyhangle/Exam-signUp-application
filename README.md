# Exam-signUp-application
A web application is needed for collecting sign-ups for exams.  A teacher can add a new exam to the application by filling in on a "New Exam" form  Course code (for example MATH103) Name of the course (for example Introduction to Geometry) Name of the exam (for example Mid-term exam) Date of the exam (for example 30.11.2015) Time of the exam (for example 14:15) Place of the exam (for example M303) On a page a teacher can see the listing of all exams and select from those any one to see the list of signed-up students.  On that same page a teacher can also remove an exam, in which case also all sign-ups to it will be deleted.  On a page a student can see the listing of all exams and select from those any one to sign up, or remove an existing sign up.  On the sign-up from the student enters her student ID, group, last name and first name and clicks "Sign Up" to sign up for the exam. If the student (as determined by the student ID) has already signed up, no action is taken.  On the remove sign-up form the student enters her student ID and clicks on the "Remove" button to remove her from the sign-up list. If the student has not signed up, no action is taken.
